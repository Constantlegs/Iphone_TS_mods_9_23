Bash start up scripts made easy. So there are several files that are responsible
For start up scripts. These scripts were located at /data/data/com.termux/files/usr/etc
In termux. This directory included bash.bashrc and profile. bash.bashrc
Checks profile for startup scripts that run only once. They do not run recursively, regardless if new
Bash shells are spawned. Child shell processes are spawned in many cases, such as calling #!/bin/bash in bash 
Shell scripts or using tools such as screen. Put your bash script directory in profile in /data/data/com.termux/files/usr/etc/profile
bash.bashrc calls profile to execute its contents, once on startup. No matter how many bash
Shell spawn form the startup scripts added in profile. If added directly to
Bash.bashrc, a recursive initiate loop occurs because these scripts run
Aany time a bash shell is launched rather spawned shell from the parent or not. 
This not work for anything other than Simple echos or any other commands that you expect
To be launched any time a new bash shell is called or spawns
.profile is only called once during reboot. Watch out for that fork bomb when calling bash 
Commands inside bashrc. It will fork bomb your system.
