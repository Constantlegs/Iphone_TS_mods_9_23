Nginx on ish does not work by default and a work-around
Has been created to allow nginx and nginx-rtmp-mod to work.
This fix seems to work, as my streamer is sending code. :D
Here are the fixes. Please implement these into any code using nginx
And ish as a terminal emulator in ios.


#To allow backgrounding in ish for ios. This must be added to scripts
#to allow backgrounding. This uses the geo exploit concept to
#overcome no backgrounding policy for ios. For a server, this is
# a perfect workaround. Must be include in bash shell script
************

cat /dev/location > /dev/null &.

*************^add to bash shell script


#also nginx.conf needs to be modified to work with ISH in ios

The most important lines are 

Add at top
**************

worker_processes 1;
daemon off;
master_process off;
 **************
And find events {} and add

events {
worker_connectiins 204800;
   multi_accept on;
}

When /run/nginx/nginx.pid is not located, nginx runs. W
If issues arise, delete the folder /run/nginx . The system runs
When it does not record it's pid /run/nginx. Good enough!
